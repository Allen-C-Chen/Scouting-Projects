# Scouting-Projects
Projects created to scout teams in FRC

#### Scouter
First scouting project in relation to FRC, created entirely over the duration of the North bay and St Louis competitions in 2015. 
Used java swing GUI, poorly implemented and organized in a few very large and messy classes. 
First attempt at a project that was a couple thousand lines long
