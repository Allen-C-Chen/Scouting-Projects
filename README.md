Projects created to scout teams in FRC each folder represents one of the projects, see the commit of each project to see a small description of the files in the program

#### Scouter
First scouting project in relation to FRC, created entirely over the duration of the North bay and St Louis competitions in 2015. 
Used java swing GUI, poorly implemented and organized in a few very large and messy classes. 
First attempt at a project that was a couple thousand lines long

#### EditScouter
Second scouting project which built upon what I learnt in the first project. Built on a concept of modfiability in that it can be modified for the different games each year through the use of the editor. Expanded my knowledge of working with java swing and interconecting the various components.
